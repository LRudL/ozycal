# ozycal
Vim-like interface for Google Calendar.

It works on my machine, not on yours.


## Motivation


> And on the pedestal these words appear:
> 
> "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings;
> 
> Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"
> 
> Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
> 
> Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
> 
> The lone and level sands stretch far away.

\- Percy Shelley, "Ozymandias"

With the productive power of ozycal, you too can become a king of kings who first achieves great things and then inevitably becomes a symbol of the transcience of all achievement.
